                        <p>My name is Annesha, and I am a 23-year-old Software Tester, with one and a half years of experience in the IT industry. After moving along the east coast of Australia, I have now settled in Brisbane Queensland, where I live with my long-term partner and my childhood dog ‘Bear’. In the next few years, I plan to move to Melbourne, however for now Brisbane is home. </p>
                        <p>In my spare time, I like to embrace creative hobbies such as knitting and sewing, and make a great effort to maintain my health with strength training workouts and walks to reduce the impacts of my chronic pain condition. </p>

                    <div class = "content">
                        <p>Ever since I was a child, I have always found computers easy to set up, use and trouble shoot.  After graduating from High school, I studied a Fine arts degree, however 18 months into the degree, I realised that I needed to work in a more technical and analytical field. I decided to take time off from study to explore my interests. During my study sabbatical, I was given a secondment opportunity at work as a database officer, which made me responsible for managing the charity’s fundraising database. In this position, I was also responsible for testing the new database management system prior to migration. I found this experience fulfilling and rewarding, and discovered that I have a strong interest in IT. Two years later, I now work as a software Tester, which has allowed me to make the most of my analytical and problem-solving skills. </p>
                        <p>For the past year, I had wanted to return to university to study IT alongside my work, however I found that traditional university was not feasible option in conjunction with full-time work. When I discovered that RMIT offered a Bachelor of IT online, I was immediately interested, given both the prestigious nature of RMIT, and the good experiences I had heard from friends who completed online studies with OUA. In the short term I would like to learn about the different fields within IT and improve my knowledge of Python scripting to assist with upcoming automation testing. In the long term I would like to increase my technical knowledge of Software Development and explore Cloud Computing, to prepare for my career as a Technical Business Analyst.</p>
